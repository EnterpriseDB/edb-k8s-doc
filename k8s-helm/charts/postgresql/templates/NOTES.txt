{{- if contains "Statefulset" .Values.deploymentType }}
The number of replicas should not be scaled greater than 1 because each container will have its own copy of data and
be considered a standalone instance.  In order to have data redundancy, a replication and a solution such as Stolon,
Patroni, etc will be needed to have availability beyond that provided by the Kubernetes.  EDBâ€™s Kubernetes Operator can
be leveraged to achieve high availability with Stolon.
{{- else }}
A single database pod will be installed in a single Kubernetes cluster. This deployment type will not provide 
data redundancy and it is not recommended for production use.
