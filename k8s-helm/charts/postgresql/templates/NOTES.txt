If deployment type is "Pod", then a single database pod will be installed in a single Kubernetes cluster. This deployment type will not provide 
data redundancy and it is not recommended for production use.

Please utilize the deployment type of "Statefulset" with replicas set to more than 1 if redundancy is desired and for production.

An EDB subscription is required for production use as well.
