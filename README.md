# EDB for Kubernetes

EDB Containers allow you to provision a high-availability EDB Postgres Advanced Server or PostgreSQL database in a cloud-agnostic environment that is certified for production deployment with any container platform technology. EDB containers provide open-source services and components that will help you build a portable, reliable, and responsive application environment.

You can use EDB Containers to create a robust production or R & D environment on Kubernetes or Docker platforms. Ease of deployment and scalability of EDB Containers will help you minimize management responsibilities while maximizing your IT budget.

Kubernetes provides business benefits:

- Manage Postgres at scale
- Deploy anywhere: Run Postgres on public, private, and hybrid clouds
- Plug into existing DevOps pipelines

Docker Containers provide business benefits:

- Easy to deploy
- Build experimental sandboxes
- You can maximise your resource budget by not having unused servers

The EDB Postgres containers are available in two flavors:

- EDB Postgres Advanced Server (EPAS)
- PostgreSQL


You can deploy containers on the following platforms:

Kubernetes provides stability in an affordable environment; you can easily:

- Manage Postgres at scale
- Deploy anywhere: Run Postgres on public, private, and hybrid clouds
- Plug into existing DevOps pipelines


Docker Containers provide an easily-managed architecture that is:

- Easy to deploy
- Perfect for experimental sandboxes
- Maximizes your resource budget


EDB Postgres Containers simplify the deployment of:

- EDB Postgres Advanced Server (EPAS)
- PostgreSQL


EPAS is based on the open-source PostgreSQL database; EPAS provides extended functionality, utilities, and compatibility for Oracle applications.  For more information about the advantages of EPAS or PostgreSQL, visit the [EDB website](www.enterprisedb.com).
