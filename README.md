# EDB for Kubernetes

The world loves PostgreSQL. If you work with developers or data scientists or anyone wrangling data, you’ll probably see a sticker with the tusks and trunk of the PostgreSQL elephant on the lid of a nearby laptop. EDB has a lot to do with that.  We’ve been major contributors to PostgreSQL since the beginning, and we are proud to call thousands of boundary pushing customers our partners. 

Proud though we are, we are not resting on our laurels. EDB continues to evolve the capabilities of the core PostgreSQL database server, but also extends the PostgresSQL and cloud ecosystems by providing tools and automation.  As you begin or expand your journey to Kubernetes for PostgreSQL, we want to be your trusted advisor. 

EDB Containers allow you to provision a high-availability EDB Postgres Advanced Server or PostgreSQL database in a cloud-agnostic environment that is certified for production deployment with any container platform technology. EDB containers provide open-source services and components that will help you build a portable, reliable, and responsive application environment.

You can use EDB Containers to create a robust production or R & D environment on Kubernetes or Docker platforms. Ease of deployment and scalability of EDB Containers will help you minimize management responsibilities while maximizing your IT budget.

Kubernetes provides stability in an affordable environment; you can easily:

- Manage Postgres at scale
- Deploy anywhere: Run Postgres on public, private, and hybrid clouds
- Plug into existing DevOps pipelines


Docker Containers provide an easily-managed architecture that is:

- Easy to deploy
- Perfect for experimental sandboxes
- Maximizes your resource budget


EDB Postgres Containers simplify the deployment of:

- EDB Postgres Advanced Server (EPAS)
- PostgreSQL

EPAS is based on the open-source PostgreSQL database; EPAS provides extended functionality, utilities, and compatibility for Oracle applications.  For more information about the advantages of EPAS or PostgreSQL, visit the [EDB website](www.enterprisedb.com).
